# Machine-Learning-Regression
In our project we have taken WDBC dataset in which features taken are computed from pictures of pre-computed from images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Our primary task is to classify suspected FNA cells to Benign (class 0) or Malignant (class 1), so we are using Binomial logistic regression.
